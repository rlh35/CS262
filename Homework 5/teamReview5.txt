Team G review
-------------------
The project management material for Team G shows a good amount of activity, although I 
don't see many hours logged on Trello by Hamin or Josh. From what I can see on github,
it looks like Chris did the majority of the commits, with not much by the other team
members. That being said, I was not privy to everything that happened within their team 
during this process, so I know that the numbers don't tell the whole story. From what 
I witnessed of them during stakeholder meetings, presentations, and user testing, they 
all seemed pretty involved, except Hamin, who I don't think I ever saw. 
Their final presentation was very good, and I was impressed by the changes they had 
made both since the last presentation, but even more so since the user testing a few 
weeks ago. The presentation adequately showed the features of the app, and had me 
wanting to install it on my own device. In regards to their presentation compared to 
the other teams, I thought there were few that went better. They seemed composed and 
knowledgeable, able to handle all the questions that came their way. 
The final application was well designed and fully functional, as far as I know. I don't 
know how much widespread use this app might get if it were published to the google play 
store, but I could see myself using it to great benefit. I have been thrilled to follow 
this team throughout the process and look forward to seeing where the project goes from 
here.
