Review of Team G
by Ryan Holwerda
--------------------
2.a	Yes. Team G's Trello board shows sufficient activity.
2.b	The UI model is a bit confusing at first glance. As an English reader, my eye is
	naturally drawn to the upper left of the diagram, but that's not where the diagram
	flow starts, which means that it takes more time to figure out what's going on than
	it should. The domain model is nice and straight forward. Given what I know from the
	vision statement and the presentation, the domain model is clear.
2.c	It looks like there are 2-3 commits per week, which is satisfactory.
2.d	I think the presentation went fairly well. A few of the presenters spoke softly or
	too quickly, which made it a little hard to understand them. Despite that, though,
	the presentation was engaging and interesting. I think they adequately conveyed all
	the necessary information in a quick, concise way.
