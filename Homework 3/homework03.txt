Homework 3
-----------
1.a	Yes. It uses the GET, PUT, POST and DELETE http commands to access the database. 
	It also uses JSON formatting to create a stateless service accessed through a 
	directory-structured URI.
1.b	The GET command is the only one of the four basic HTTP commands that is nullipotent,
	because there are no side effects to using it on the same data repeatedly. GET, UPDATE
	and DELETE are all idempotent, meaning the same commands can be run repeatedly and
	the results are the same every time.
1.c	Yes. We're implementing our app in Java, which is an object oriented language, but 
	we're connecting the functionality to a relational database, which is not object
	oriented.
1.d	I don't think so, no.
