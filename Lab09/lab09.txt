9.1.a	    There are 5 endpoints, implemented in the work.sh
	  
9.1.b.i	    JDBC
9.1.b.ii.1  An SQL query references a relation within the database, whereas the JDBC Statement
	    object only knows about the endpoints.
9.1.b.ii.2  In SQL, a relation is a table storing data, a JDBC result set is contains only
	    the result of the JDBC query, and a List<Player> is a Java list that contains
	    the attributs of a player.
9.1.b.iii   Used anytime the queried relation contains null or string values.
	  
9.1.c.i	    Allows for database manipulation using an object-oriented method.
9.1.c.ii    This contains the data from one tuple in the Player table. The Player table,
	    on the other hand, stores all of the data in the relation rather than just
	    one tuple.
